### üìÑ `sales-nav-expand-descriptions.js`

* **What it does:** When you're on a LinkedIn Sales Navigator search results page, this script finds and clicks every "...see more" button for the listed accounts. This allows you to see the full "About" description for all results on the page at once.
* **How to use:**
    1.  On a Sales Navigator search results page, open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`).
    2.  Navigate to the "Console" tab.
    3.  Copy and paste the entire script into the console.
    4.  Press `Enter` to run it.
